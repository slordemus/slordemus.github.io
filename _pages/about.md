<img src="/images/Quran_Ottoman_18th.png" alt="drawing" width="300" height="400" style="float: left; padding-right:20px"/> Welcome to this page. My name is Samuel Lordemus and I am a postdoc at the Center for Health, Policy and Economics, University of Lucerne. Before joining Lucerne, I held a Research Fellow position at the Centre for Health Economics, University of York. I received a PhD in Economics from the University of Sheffield, and a MSc from Paris School of Economics. <br>

My research interests are in health and development economics, with a particular focus on the determinants of public healthcare financing in conflict settings and the role of donors. <br>
